Firm Employment Dynamics in Kazakhstan after Sudden Russian Immigration</a>
</span> (with Yelzhas Kadyr and Aigerim Yergabulova)<br>
<span class="paperInfo">

                        	<p class="abstractInfo">
Kazakhstan was the top destination country for Russian immigrants in 2022, a year when Russian emigration sharply increased due to new international sanctions and war mobilization. The circumstances offer a rare opportunity to explore how a large sudden skill-abundant immigration within an economic union affects firm employment dynamics for a middle-income receiving country. Kazakhstan and Russia share the world's longest continuous land border, so immigration effects are regionally dispersed rather than concentrated solely in cities, and Kazakhstan offers business registers data to explore firm-level employment dynamics. Absent fine regional data on immigration flows, our empirical approach uses a pre-war share of the Russian population in 215 districts of Kazakhstan as a reduced-form instrument for the treatment of Russian immigration. We find no pre-war trends in firm employment growth related to the Russian district population shares. Using difference-in-differences estimation, we find large effects of 2022 Russian immigration on the employment growth for Kazakhstan's incumbent firms in more affected regions. The employment growth is larger for small firms, young foreign-owned firms, older domestic firms, and ICT firms, and results are robust to the exclusion or inclusion of Kazakhstan's two major cities of Almaty and Astana. We estimate that Kazakhstan's regions, excluding the two major cities, would have experienced a private sector employment fall of 86,500 in 2022 rather than the actual increase of 21,500 if Russian immigration flows had not occurred.

<p class="abstractInfo">
We find that air pollution increases crime in a city that ranks in the worst two percentiles worldwide for dirty winter air. Our identification strategy employs distinct geographic features of Almaty, Kazakhstan: cleaner mountain winds and frequent temperature inversions. Using these variables to instrument for PM2.5 air pollution, we estimate a PM2.5 elasticity of the expected crime rate more than four times as large as similar estimates from cleaner cities. Among crime types, we estimate statistically significant effects of air pollution on property crime, and we find no evidence of an effect on violent crime. These results are consistent with theory that air pollution induces higher discounting rather than aggression. We extend this theory and find that whether air pollution has distinct effects on crimes of varying severity depends on whether the population is more heterogenous in the outside option or in the discount factor. Using microdata on crime severity, we find statistically significant increases in both major and minor crime rates from air pollution, and we fail to reject common PM2.5 elasticities of minor and major crime rates. The greater scale of major crimes implies that they contribute more to the total crime rate increase from air pollution.&nbsp;</p>

Much potential for trade liberalization exists in industries and markets with trade barriers that are prohibitive for all or many firms. In standard political economic theories of trade policy, observed prohibitive barriers must be globally optimal according to static government preferences, leaving no possibility for a trade agreement. This paper shows that for prohibitive policies in imperfectly competitive markets, a trade agreement can still play a role even without any changes in governments' policy preferences. Theory can then further identify market characteristics for which liberalization is most likely to be feasible. To illustrate the simplest case, we consider a two-country model with firms engaged in Cournot competition in segmented markets. For plausible ranges of political weights on firm profits, there is a role for a trade agreement in eliminating prohibitive trade barriers. We then consider how the potential for cooperation varies with trade costs and competition. Industries with more firm heterogeneity have greater potential for cooperation, provided that the lower productivity firms are sufficiently competitive. The implications of these results are discussed for negotiations involving either developing country exporters or services trade, two areas in which prohibitive trade barriers remain important.<br>

This paper critiques a Panel ruling that was permissive in allowing the EU to exclude China from the renegotiations of several tariff lines of poultry meat and the related allocation of new tariff-rate quotas. The EU's basis for exclusion was that China lacked a principal or substantial supplying interest in the modified tariff lines. The Panel's ruling supported China for only two tariff lines in which China eventually served 50 percent of the EU market after certain SPS measures expired, on the narrow basis that this import increase should have been considered a special factor in the TRQ allocation. The paper argues that the Panel ruled too narrowly by disregarding China's broader claims for a principal or substantial supplying interest. An interpretation consistent with the object and purpose of the GATT supports utilizing a broader set of evidence in China's claim as a principal or substantial supplier for renegotiations of tariff schedules. Allowing nations to use tariff-rate quotas to prevent emerging markets from achieving a substantial supplying interest is a significant obstacle to the WTO's purpose. The Panel's ruling will be important for future tariff-rate quota renegotiations, such as those that would be necessary under Brexit.

This paper shows that electoral incentives affect the occurrence of  trade disputes. Focusing on WTO disputes filed by the United States during the 1995-2012 period, we show that U.S. presidents are more likely to initiate a dispute in the year preceding their re-election date. Moreover, disputes filed by the U.S. tend to target industries that are important to swing states in the presidential election. To explain these regularities, we develop a theoretical model in which an incumbent can file a trade dispute to appeal to voters motivated by reciprocity.  The incumbent's ability to initiate a dispute during the re-election campaign provides an advantage over the challenger, who cannot commit to file the dispute if elected.
 If voters' ideological preferences are not too strong in favor of either candidate, the incumbent will file a trade dispute to increase his re-election chances.

service vary in their impact across low-income racial groups, gender, age, and home ownership. Our demand specification includes both the subsidized monthly price (Lifeline program) and the subsidized initial connection price (Linkup program) for local telephone service. Our quasimaximum likelihood estimation controls for location differences and instruments for price
endogeneity. The microdata allow us to estimate the effects of demographics on both elasticities of telephone penetration and the level of telephone penetration. Based on our preferred estimates, the subsidy programs increased aggregate penetration by 6.1% for low-income households. Our results suggest that Linkup is more cost-effective than Lifeline and that auto-enroll policies are important, which calls into question a recent FCC (2012) decision to reduce Linkup subsidies in favor of Lifeline. Our study can inform the evaluation of similar universal service policies for Internet access.&nbsp; <a id="abstractLink" href="javascript:toggle2('abstract1','myHeader1');" >Close</a></p></div>

This paper considers trade agreement outcomes based on the principle of
reciprocity in a setting where governments negotiate tariff cuts to shift
rents to politically-powerful exporters. I develop a concept of reciprocity
that both nests prior approaches and selects a Pareto efficient outcome for
trade agreements in my setting of interest. In the negotiations, the agreed
tariff cuts effectively substitute for export policies and deliver the same
amount of liberalization as if governments negotiated directly over export
policies. Exporters with greater political power then compel greater
reductions in cooperative import tariffs through trade negotiations ---
reductions so large that losses to domestic firms from import competition
outweigh gains from cheaper imports. Because governments deviating from the
negotiated outcome can achieve first-order gains by increasing prices for
the import-competing sector, even without terms-of-trade gains, the model
provides a new common explanation for a variety of trade policy
observations, such as temporary trade barriers from small countries,
red-tape barriers, and globalization backlash.

This paper proposes a theory of subsidy bans that aligns well with their
negotiating history across major sectors. A challenge for standard trade
agreement theories is explaining why countries would cooperate to ban
trading partner's export-promoting subsidies, which improve the terms of
trade of imports. Trade negotiation records suggest a rationale to explore
formally: concerns over lost sales of import-competing firms dominate other
concerns as markets integrate. The challenge for building this motive into
theory is that government preferences implying subsidy bans also imply that
nations would not open markets through tariff cuts in the first place. To
resolve this challenge, I consider governments who pursue tariff cuts in
negotiations as a second-best approach for shifting rents to exporters.
Given any motive to promote exporters, countries negotiate tariff cuts so
large that they seek price increases in import sectors. Sufficient desire to
prevent further price decreases in import sectors then motivates enforcement
of subsidy bans. The subsidy bans are desirable only after sufficient trade
frictions have been removed, so the theory aligns well with the history that
consensus subsidy restrictions were achieved first in manufacturing, then in
agriculture, and not yet in services.

In trade agreements, governments can design remedies to ensure compliance (property rule) or to compensate victims (liability rule). This paper describes an economic framework to explain the
pattern of remedies over non-tariff restrictions---particularly domestic subsidies and nonviolation complaints subject to liability rules. The key determinants of the contract form for any individual measure are the expected joint surplus from an agreement and the expected loss to the constrained government. The loss is higher for domestic subsidies and nonviolations because these are the policies most likely to correct domestic distortions. Governments choose property
rules when expected gains from compliance are sufficiently high and expected losses to the constrained country are sufficiently low. Liability rules are preferable when dispute costs are
relatively high, because inefficiencies in the compensation process reduce the number of socially inefficient disputes filed.

Many international trade agreements regulate the use of domestic policies. One approach is "deep" integration, in which governments contract directly over domestic policies. An appealing alternative is "shallow" integration, in which nations contract over market access and avoid negotiations over specific policies. I generalize the shallow integration approach to a two-country differentiated-product setting. Governments choose trade policies and two domestic policies: a wage subsidy and a policy reducing the capital requirement for firm entry. I show that the sole source of international inefficiency is terms-of-trade manipulation and that the appropriate terms-of-trade definition here is a world price index. Shallow integration works because changes in domestic policies and trade policies that preserve market access also preserve the terms of trade. I discuss potential obstacles for shallow integration. Absent trade policy cooperation, direct negotiations over the wage subsidy cannot benefit governments, but direct negotiations over the entry policy provide a second-best benefit. The efficient agreement in theory differs significantly from the shallow integration approach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).&nbsp;</p>
