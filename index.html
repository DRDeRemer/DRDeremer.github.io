This paper critiques a Panel ruling that was permissive in allowing the EU to exclude China from the renegotiations of several tariff lines of poultry meat and the related allocation of new tariff-rate quotas. The EU's basis for exclusion was that China lacked a principal or substantial supplying interest in the modified tariff lines. The Panel's ruling supported China for only two tariff lines in which China eventually served 50 percent of the EU market after certain SPS measures expired, on the narrow basis that this import increase should have been considered a special factor in the TRQ allocation. The paper argues that the Panel ruled too narrowly by disregarding China's broader claims for a principal or substantial supplying interest. An interpretation consistent with the object and purpose of the GATT supports utilizing a broader set of evidence in China's claim as a principal or substantial supplier for renegotiations of tariff schedules. Allowing nations to use tariff-rate quotas to prevent emerging markets from achieving a substantial supplying interest is a significant obstacle to the WTO's purpose. The Panel's ruling will be important for future tariff-rate quota renegotiations, such as those that would be necessary under Brexit.

This paper shows that electoral incentives affect the occurrence of  trade disputes. Focusing on WTO disputes filed by the United States during the 1995-2012 period, we show that U.S. presidents are more likely to initiate a dispute in the year preceding their re-election date. Moreover, disputes filed by the U.S. tend to target industries that are important to swing states in the presidential election. To explain these regularities, we develop a theoretical model in which an incumbent can file a trade dispute to appeal to voters motivated by reciprocity.  The incumbent's ability to initiate a dispute during the re-election campaign provides an advantage over the challenger, who cannot commit to file the dispute if elected.
 If voters' ideological preferences are not too strong in favor of either candidate, the incumbent will file a trade dispute to increase his re-election chances.

                        	<div id="abstract1" style="display: none;"><p class="abstractInfo">This policy study uses U.S. Census microdata to evaluate how subsidies for universal telephone
service vary in their impact across low-income racial groups, gender, age, and home ownership. Our demand specification includes both the subsidized monthly price (Lifeline program) and the subsidized initial connection price (Linkup program) for local telephone service. Our quasimaximum likelihood estimation controls for location differences and instruments for price
endogeneity. The microdata allow us to estimate the effects of demographics on both elasticities of telephone penetration and the level of telephone penetration. Based on our preferred estimates, the subsidy programs increased aggregate penetration by 6.1% for low-income households. Our results suggest that Linkup is more cost-effective than Lifeline and that auto-enroll policies are important, which calls into question a recent FCC (2012) decision to reduce Linkup subsidies in favor of Lifeline. Our study can inform the evaluation of similar universal service policies for Internet access.&nbsp; <a id="abstractLink" href="javascript:toggle2('abstract1','myHeader1');" >Close</a></p></div>

Much potential for trade liberalization exists in industries and markets with trade barriers that are prohibitive for all or many firms. In standard political economic theories of trade policy, observed prohibitive barriers must be globally optimal according to static government preferences, leaving no possibility for a trade agreement. This paper shows that for prohibitive policies in imperfectly competitive markets, a trade agreement can still play a role even without any changes in governments' policy preferences. Theory can then further identify market characteristics for which liberalization is most likely to be feasible. To illustrate the simplest case, we consider a two-country model with firms engaged in Cournot competition in segmented markets. For plausible ranges of political weights on firm profits, there is a role for a trade agreement in eliminating prohibitive trade barriers. We then consider how the potential for cooperation varies with trade costs and competition. Industries with more firm heterogeneity have greater potential for cooperation, provided that the lower productivity firms are sufficiently competitive. The implications of these results are discussed for negotiations involving either developing country exporters or services trade, two areas in which prohibitive trade barriers remain important.<br>

This paper considers how offshoring and rent-seeking influence trade negotiation outcomes. In such modern trade environments, governments have reason to use trade agreements to expand export volumes of both final goods and intermediates beyond what would be expected from standard trade models in which eliminating terms-of-trade manipulation is the only source of gains from a trade agreement. Following accepted GATT/WTO negotiation principles, we consider agreements that achieve the stable end point of reciprocal negotiations, meaning neither government can gain from policy changes that affect net export value equally, We show this end point is still Pareto efficient for governments, so it is still a suitable prediction for the trade negotiation outcome. This stable and efficient outcome for modern trade environments yields new predictions that are consistent with empirical evidence. More politically-organized exporters with large supply elasticities compel greater reductions in cooperative import tariffs from trade negotiations. Governments jointly pursue gains for exporters to the extent that they would assess losses for domestic firms from import competition to be outweighing gains for consumers.&nbsp; <a id="abstractLink" href="javascript:toggle2('abstract10','myHeader10');" >Close</a>

Many international trade agreements regulate the use of domestic policies. One approach is "deep" integration, in which governments contract directly over domestic policies. An appealing alternative is "shallow" integration, in which nations contract over market access and avoid negotiations over specific policies. I generalize the shallow integration approach to a two-country differentiated-product setting. Governments choose trade policies and two domestic policies: a wage subsidy and a policy reducing the capital requirement for firm entry. I show that the sole source of international inefficiency is terms-of-trade manipulation and that the appropriate terms-of-trade definition here is a world price index. Shallow integration works because changes in domestic policies and trade policies that preserve market access also preserve the terms of trade. I discuss potential obstacles for shallow integration. Absent trade policy cooperation, direct negotiations over the wage subsidy cannot benefit governments, but direct negotiations over the entry policy provide a second-best benefit. The efficient agreement in theory differs significantly from the shallow integration approach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).&nbsp;</p>

Why did countries achieve a consensus to restrict export subsidies and export-promoting domestic subsidies when the World Trade Organization (WTO) began in 1995, but not decades earlier under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)? This question poses a challenge for the theory of trade agreements because export promotion improves the terms of trade of importers, so subsidy restrictions reduce the welfare of importing nations. This paper argues that cross-border externalities arising from political economy and profit-shifting can explain the historical pattern of subsidy rules. Motives to restrict export promotion do not exist when trade policies are chosen noncooperatively, because import tariff revenue neutralizes any motive for export promotion. Once import tariffs fall, as in the 1950s and 1960s, then motives to restrict export promotion can arise. Governments prefer to protect domestic sales through international subsidy restraints rather than to allow consumers to benefit from unfettered subsidization. Governments could in theory have eliminated the need for subsidy rules by eliminating domestic intersectoral misallocation or by adjusting both import taxes and export subsidies consistent with the GATT principle of reciprocity, but in practice they have not done so. GATT documents and the WTO negotiating history provide support for the theory that the WTO subsidy rules address an international profit-shifting problem.&nbsp;<a id="abstractLink" href="javascript:toggle2('abstract2','myHeader2');" >Close</a>
